- switched to Mark Kilgard's TexFont for Fonts (not permanent, because

- hopefully didn't break the rpm.specs

to 0.47: (all changes by Thomas Flynn)
- Added ifdefs to .h files to allow multiple inclusion

- Moved a bunch of functions from gltron.c to engine.c
  These seem to be functions necessary for the game and do not contain OpenGL
  or glut code.  List of functions are:
	setCol();
	clearCol();
	getCol();
	turn();
	initDisplay();
	changeDisplay();
	initGame();
	initdata();
	colldetect();
	doTrail();
	fixTrails();
	clearTrails();
	mainIdle();
	gameIdle();
	defaultDisplay();
	cycleDisplay();
	allAI();
	resetScores();
	movePlayers();
	timediff();
	chaseCamMove();
	camMove();
	screenSaverCheck();

- Added argument to drawTraces() so that pfTron knows which player (0,1,2,3)
  to draw traces for.

- Created getElapsedTime() to replace frequent calls to 
  glutGet(GLUT_ELAPSED_TIME); which are specific to glut.

- Changed name of Display structure to gDisplay.  Conflicts with Display 
  structure in Xlib.h

- Changed movePlayers() to call setGameIdleFunc() where it used to call 
  glutIdleFunc().  Needed to move that glut call elsewhere.

- Changed it so that scores are not updated if in screensaver mode.
  Didn't seem to make sense.  If you disagree, lemme know.

- Changed it so that the sound file is searched for in $GLTRON_SNDDIR then ./
  then /usr/share/games/gltron.

- Decided to get consistant with the naming.  All instances of gltron are now
  gltron.

- Added gltron.rpm.spec and gltron_sound.rpm.spec.

- New Makefile.  New rules: install, packages.  Must be root for both.
  The packages rule makes .rpms, .tgz, and .deb files.

to 0.46:
- fixed bug with -k option, no more crashes
- capped FPS at 90-100 FPS (you need more???)
- fixed crazy FPS counter under windows - now shows the real numbers
- fixed alternate camera mode under windows
- did a new windows version (with sound!)
- included glut.dll in the win32 distribution
- changed texture format, it's now char[] instead of char*, that should
remove problems with non-gcc compilers
- fullscreen rendering under win32 (switched to glutGameMode where avaiable)
- added '-i' switch, forces in-a-window-rendering under win32
- added '-v' switch, demo/screensafer mode (don't use with -f!)
to 0.45:
- added sound (Song by Peter Hajba)
- added load/save for preferences
- split code over several files

to 0.44: 
- added help screen

to 0.43:
- fixed bug with uninitialised variable 'loop' in mainIdle() that
  caused the game to crash sometimes

to 0.42:

- added glow around players (patch from Xavier Bouchoux)
- added second camera (patch from Mike Field)
- added nice color fade to model color where actually the bikes should be
  (I hope I'll receive the models soon)
- added optional erasing of crashed players (like in the movie)
- added optional fast finishing of the game after human crashes (no more
  long wait for next round if the computers decide to go in circles around
  the block)
- added message who actually won the round (if you can't find it, it's
  at the bottom of the screen)
- added CREDITS file
- added keys for steering player 3 & 4 (you're silly if you think you
  can get 4 people to use one keyboard)
- fixed a few minor bugs (e.g. speed change is now persistent)
- changed behaviour of Display->onScreen
- added keys for cycling players in upper/lower window in split-screen mode
- changed FOV to 105
- added keys to change FOV
- introduced a bug that makes the game freeze (very very rare), perhaps
  someone finds out why?

to 0.41:

- changed floor & wall textures (I'm still no artist though) 
- changed trail colors to fit new floor texture
- multiple perspectives, view 1, 2 or 4 players (F1-F3 changes
  that on the fly) - it's worth the download!
- fixed typos with -h switch
- fixed Makefile, compiles now with -O2 instead of -g (debug)
  I can't see an obvious speed increase though
- added this CHANGELOG file
