GLtron - Installation from source

If you install from CVS, read also README.CVS

Requirements:

Get a working OpenGL / Mesa installation
Get libpng / zlib (standard on almost any system)
Get SDL-1.2 (1.1 might work, but is unsupported)

If you want sound, you need to grab SDL_sound 0.1.4 or later from
http://icculus.org/SDL_sound/

Required libraries for SDL_sound: libmikmod 3.1.5 or newer

Compiling:

./configure
make

And (probably as root)
make install

Data files get installed by default to /usr/local/share/gltron
The config file gets stored in $HOME/.gltronrc and any screenshots you
make get stored in $HOME/gltron-$version-$index.png

You can tweak most file locations using ./configure options.
Try ./configure --help

If you want to play from the source directory, use
./configure --enable-localdata

GLtron will then chdir() to the binary location upon startup, and
load things from there. This is useful for the loki installer.
You can put everything (binary & data) into one directory, and but
a symlink into e.g. /usr/local/bin.

Usage:

'gltron -h' lists a few runtime options. Most notably is the -O option,
which will speed things up greatly *if you don't have a 3D card*. Don't
use this unless the game runs really slow, the visuals will suffer terribly.

Start gltron with the -s option if you don't want the sound playing.
