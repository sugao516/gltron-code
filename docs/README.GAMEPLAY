This is very brief.

Use up/down/enter/escape to navigate the menus.
Use left/right to change values (e.g. sound volume)

Default keys: 'a'/'s' and 'k'/'l' for player 1/2
The mouse can be used to control the camera, use the buttons
to zoom in/out.

The game is most fun if several players play in split screen mode
(quickly accessible via f1-f3).
