Q:
  Something doesn't work.
A:
  The first thing to try is to delete the ~/.gltronrc file.
  It'll restore sane default settings.

Q:
  when I try to switch resolutions I get something along the lines of

X Error of failed request:  BadValue (integer parameter out of range for operation)
  Major opcode of failed request:  142 (XFree86-DRI)
  Minor opcode of failed request:  9 ()
  Value in failed request:  0x45
  Serial number of failed request:  28
  Current serial number in output stream:  28

and the program exits.

A:
   It's a bug in X4/DRI. I can't do anything about that.
   To change the resolution, just edit ~/.gltronrc 
   Look for 'width' and 'height'.

Q:
   The lightcycle trails are transparent, I only see a few white lines

A:
   Some Matrox (G200/G400) and ATI (Rage128) drivers are broken.
   Make sure you have the latest drivers. If that doesn't help,
   go to Video->Texturing and turn Trail Decals off.
