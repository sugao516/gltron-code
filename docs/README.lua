GLTron uses Lua-4.0

Lua's homepage is at http://www.lua.org/

You may get lua-4.0.tar.gz if you would like to see the original package in its
entirety.

The GLTron source code only contains enough to use lua with liblua and
liblualib, plus some new Makefile.am files for an integrated build process.
