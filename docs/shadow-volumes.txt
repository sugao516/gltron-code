- (done) Draw Object to fb & z, using (weaker) cameralight, and clear stencil
- Draw Shadow Volume to stencil buffer (using z-fail or z-pass)
- (done) Draw Object with sky light, but only where stencil is 0

z-pass: find edge polygons, and extrude from light until z <= 0 (e.g. project
to floor)

z-fail: find edges as above, plus draw front facing polys normally, and
extrude backfaces until z <= 0 (e.g. project to floor).

Tasks needed:

- Transform light into model space
- Tag all polys as front or back-facing
- Create index buffer for front facing polys
- Create index buffer for back facing polys
- Walk adjacency list to create edge polys:
	- create two vertices original edge
	- create two vertices extruded in light direction for extruded edge
